Installation
============

Install admin, ideally inside a `virtualenv <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    pip install piccolo_admin


To run a demo locally go to piccolo_admin directory, using Python 3.7 or above:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    cd piccolo_admin
    admin_demo


And then just launch `<localhost:8000>`_ in your browser.

To see what happens behind the scenes, see ``piccolo_admin/example.py``.

In a few lines of code we are able to:

* Define our models
* Setup a database
* Create a REST API
* Setup a web server and admin interface
