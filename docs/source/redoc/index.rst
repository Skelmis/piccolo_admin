Redoc documentation
===================

During development is useful to have api documentation with all the methods and parameters per table.
After login in Piccolo admin you can go to ``localhost:8000/admin/api/tables/your_table/redoc`` and see
`Redoc <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_ api documentation for your table.
